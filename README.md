# FlagToBanner
A quick and dirty tool I made to change the shape and some of the contents of HoI4 flags to look more like banners. 

## Instructions
Just give it the full path to the mod's flags directory. 
It will then automatically find all the flags and resize them to a banner shape, and then fill all the empty space with the flags most common colour.
